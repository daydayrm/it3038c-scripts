                                                                  RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR
                                                                  
For my final project, I chose to do a password generator. I know there are a lot of ones out there but I wanted one for myself that had no way of storing the passwords.
I have used a password generator for years for my passwords so they are completely random and can't be associated with other accounts.
As a college student, we have many accounts on various websites and chances are you have used the same password much more than once. As a cybersecurity major, I try
very hard not to use the same passwords on accounts and websites just incase the worst happens. 


The password generator I created uses the modules string and secret. It will ask the user for the length of the password they want. There are no options to select
special characters, lowercase, or uppercase letters. The script automatically includes that in the selection for the best password safety. 
The user will then input the password length and the script will produce the password and print and diplay it for the user.

The user is responsible for copying that password or they can simply run the script again to get another password. The script has no way of storing the information or
password for the user. This ensures the password integrity.
