For Project 2, I will be writing a script that will import the calendar from any year and any month. 

I will be using "calendar" as a module in this project. 

It will need user input to know what year and month to import the calendar for, so the script will ask for user input.

The second half of my script will consist of the same module, but will use a different function that determines the leap year.

I used an easy way of reading and storing the user input becasue I'm most familiar with it, the Calendar module has a lot of functions so I chose the two that are most interesting to me, and that I would use.

The user will input a year, and the script will determine if it was a leap year or not with True or False.
