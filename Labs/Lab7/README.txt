The module/plugin that I chose for this Lab was "math". It is a simple but very very useful plugin. To install this plugin, you use the code 
"pip install python-math" with no quotation marks. You will need to pip to install this plugin. The script will just offer to answer a few math equations for the user
with some feedback that will be read by the script.
